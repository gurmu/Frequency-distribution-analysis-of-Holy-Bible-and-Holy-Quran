I've created a production-ready FastAPI application for your Ivanti incident management. Here's what I've implemented:
Key Features:

Dynamic User Input: All fields except ProfileLink_RecID are accepted from the user
Input Validation: Uses Pydantic models with enums for data validation
Static ITSM ID: ProfileLink_RecID is hardcoded as a constant
RESTful API Design: Clean endpoint structure
Error Handling: Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
API Documentation: Auto-generated Swagger UI at /docs

How to Run:
bash# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests pydantic

# Run the server
python your_file.py

# Or with uvicorn directly
uvicorn your_file:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Testing the API:
1. Using curl:
bashcurl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/incidents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject": "Application Login Issue",
    "symptom": "Users unable to login since 9 AM",
    "status": "Logged",
    "impact": "High",
    "category": "Software",
    "service": "Software",
    "owner_team": "IT Support"
  }'
2. Using Python requests:
pythonimport requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/incidents",
    json={
        "subject": "Network Outage",
        "symptom": "Complete network connectivity loss in Building A",
        "impact": "Critical",
        "category": "Network",
        "service": "Network",
        "owner_team": "Network Operations"
    }
)
print(response.json())
3. Visit Swagger UI:
Navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive API documentation where you can test directly in your browser.
API Endpoints:

GET / - Health check
POST /incidents - Create new incident (main endpoint)
GET /incidents/schema - Get valid field values

The API is now ready to integrate with your agentic AI solution! 🚀
